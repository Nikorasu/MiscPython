# Miscellaneous Python Projects

This is a collection of my smaller Python projects that don't fit elsewhere.

## CalcPi

These are scripts I wrote to play with and visualize generating digits of Pi.

While researching that, I came across an article on [Spigot algorithms for Pi](https://www.gavalas.dev/blog/spigot-algorithms-for-pi-in-python/),
and their various Python implementations. The author seems to have discovered
one of the fastest ways of doing that in Python, & I couldn't find any faster.

Using the generator function by [GavalasDev](https://github.com/GavalasDev),
`CalcPi.py` & `CalcTau.py` live-print the digits in color to the terminal, and
`PiPixel.py` & `TauPixel.py` use Pygame to draw digits as color-coded pixels.
`DigitCompare.py` takes 1000 digits of half-Pi, Pi, and Tau, prints them out
together in rows, coloring digits which overlap in either 2 or all 3 rows.
